# RiVirtual.in – Manual Testing Project Documentation

## Project Overview
RiVirtual is a global PropTech / FinTech real-estate technology platform that aims to simplify and digitize property discovery, listing, management, and real-estate services for investors, buyers, sellers, agents, developers, and real-estate professionals. 
What RiVirtual Does — Key Services & Features
Property Listings & Marketplace: RiVirtual lists residential and commercial properties (for sale or rent), helping buyers/investors browse through a catalog of available real-estate options across many locations. 
Real-Estate Intelligence & Market Insights: Through data & analytics, RiVirtual provides real-estate intelligence — helping users assess properties with data on availability, pricing, affordability, and locality trends. 
CRM & Professional Tools for Agents / Developers: It offers tools for real-estate agents, brokers, developers — like CRM for lead and contact management, property management, and sales/marketing support.
Valuation & Advisory Services: For properties, RiVirtual supports valuation services — helping estimate fair market value by combining public data with local expertise, market trends, neighborhood insights, and property condition.
Reputation Management for Real-Estate Professionals: Recently, RiVirtual launched a reputation-management platform for agents, professionals, and builders — enabling management of reviews, feedback, and online presence to build trust in the industry
